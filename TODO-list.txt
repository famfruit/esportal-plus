TODO:

*) KD button Overhaul
    :heavy_check_mark: Verify that the calculations are correct
    :heavy_check_mark: The calls to "getMatches" and "getIndividualMatches" are weird. Dont use the result from the method calls

*) Ensure Autoaccept works more than once, without reload
   :heavy_check_mark: This works now?

*) Implement autocommend fully
   :heavy_check_mark: Handle page swaps, stop timer
   :heavy_check_mark: Dont start timer if the user itself is not in the game
